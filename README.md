To develop a packet sniffer tool, we'll use Python and a powerful library called scapy. scapy is capable of sending, sniffing, parsing, and forging network packets. It's a comprehensive tool for network analysis.
Run the Script: Execute the script with administrator or root privileges since capturing packets requires elevated permissions.
sh
Copy code
sudo python packetsnif.py
Analyze Output: The script prints the source and destination IP addresses, protocol, and payload data for each captured packet.
This script provides a basic framework. You can expand it to include more detailed analysis, filtering, saving captured data to files, or creating a more user-friendly interface.
